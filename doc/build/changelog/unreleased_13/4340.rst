    The "selectin" loader strategy now omits the JOIN in the case of a simple
    one-to-many load, where it instead relies loads only from the related
    table, relying upon the foreign key columns of the related table in order
    to match up to primary keys in the parent table.   This optimization can be
    disabled by setting the :paramref:`.relationship.omit_join` flag to False.
    Many thanks to Jayson Reis for the efforts on this.
